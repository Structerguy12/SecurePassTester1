<h1 align="center">SecureAuthenticator</h1>

<p>Create a simulation of a login system that prompts for a password and only displays the invitation if the entered password matches the predefined one in the program. In case of an error, display an error message and request to re-enter the password. After 3 failed attempts, the program should display a message about an unauthorized access attempt and terminate.
For an added complexity:
a) Include a user database (login and password) in the program and require not only entering the password but also the corresponding login.</p>
